# Laboratory Work 2 - Sorting Algorithms Analysis

## Overview
This laboratory work focuses on the study and empirical analysis of sorting algorithms. The analysis includes QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and Radix Sort, along with their optimized versions. The goal is to compare their efficiency through empirical testing and visualization.

## Implemented Work
I created two Jupyter notebooks to conduct experiments:
- **Local Execution:** Conducted experiments on my personal machine.
- **Google Colab Execution:** Performed similar tests on Google Colab to assess performance differences.

## Bonus Tasks
As part of the bonus tasks, I implemented:
- **Optimized Algorithms:** Improved versions of sorting algorithms (e.g., Median-of-Three pivot selection for QuickSort, Bottom-Up MergeSort, Ternary HeapSort, Iterative MSD Radix Sort).
- **Visualization in Pygame:** A visual representation of sorting algorithms using Pygame.

## Running the Visualization
To view the sorting animation, run the following script:
```bash
python animation.py
```
This script provides a step-by-step visualization of sorting algorithms, demonstrating their execution process in real time.

## Reference
This work is based on the report included in the document **FAF233_PatriciaMoraru_LW2.pdf**, which contains detailed explanations, performance evaluation, and theoretical insights.
